I am student of the Seoul national university major in statistics and mathematics. Here is the milestone on my interest in mathematics and statistics.

At the year 2022, I had a shallow interest on mathematical optimization and deep neural networks. The next year 2023, I changed my interest to analysis. I learned basic knowledge about fourier analsys, complex analysis and real analysis by reading Stein & Shakarchi's books. My interest continued to 2024, and studied probability theory. While doing this, I found topology is quite an attractive field. So since 2025, I am focusing on studying topology and geometry.

- 이인석, 선형대수와 군 (Linear Algebra and Group) (2015)
- James Munkres, Topology (2014)
- John M. Lee, Introduction to smooth manifolds (2002)
- John M. Lee, Introduction to riemannian manifolds (2018)
- John W. Milnor, Topology from the differentiable viewpoint (1997)
- Durrett, Probability (2019)
