I am student of the Seoul national university major in statistics and mathematics. Currently, I am interested in Algebraic Topology and Manifold theory. 
Manifolds have special topological aspects. Popular example is the famous Poncare duality. Also, while seeking differential objects on smooth manifolds, topological properties came out. I am interested in these connections.
