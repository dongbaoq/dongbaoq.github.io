Homology : definition and technique
========

## Relative Homology

Relative homology defined as $H_n (X,A)$ is interpreted as following:

It is represented by relative cycle $\varphi \in C_n (X)$ that $\partial \varphi \in C_n (A)$. So draw an image cycle whose boundary belongs to $A$.

This relative cycle is trivial if $\varphi = \partial \psi + \varphi^{A}$ where $\psi \in C_{n+1} (X)$, $\varphi^{A} \in C_{n} (A)$.

Homology is hard to imagine what it states for. It's because homology is the form $ker \partial / im \partial$. We need to imagine homology by specific cycle which is much easier to believe. Only aware of the fact that there are several other cycles that match with the cycle by equivalent classes.
