Relative Homology

Relative homology defined as $`H_n (X,A)`$ is interpreted as following:

It is represented by relative cycle $`\varphi` \in C_n (X)$ that $`\partial \varphi \in C_n (A)`$.

This relative cycle is trivial if $`\varphi = \partial \psi + \varphi '`$ where $`\psi \in C_{n+1} (X)`$, $`\varphi ' \in C_{n} (A)`$.
