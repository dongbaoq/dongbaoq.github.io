I gave a lecture series on p-adic numbers in the SNU winter mentoring program. The Lecture notes are available below.

I followed the book "p-adic Numbers: An Introduction" by Fernando Q. Gouvêa. I covered the construction of p-adic numbers, their basic properties, and their major applications in number theory. Using the Hensel's Lemma and Hasse-Minkowski theorem, I explained how p-adic numbers can be used to solve Diophantine equations. Especially, I focused on the Gauss's three sum of squares theorem.
Moreover, I covered some basic analysis on p-adic numbers and field extensions of p-adic numbers, which is an typical topic in algebraic number theory.

The Lecture notes are organized as follows:

- 1, 2: Motivation and construction of p-adic numbers

- 3: Structure of p-adic numbers, their valuation

- 4: Basic analysis of p-adic numbers, including cauchy sequences and continuity

- 5: Hensel's lemma and its applications

- 6: More on the analysis of p-adic numbers, Strassmann's theorem and logarithm, exponential

- 7, 8: Field extensions of p-adic numbers
